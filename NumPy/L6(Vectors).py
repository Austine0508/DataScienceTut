# Vectors are 1-D arrays
# They can be Horizontal or Verticcal

v1=np.array([1,2,3]) # Horizontal Vector
v2=np.array([1],[2],[3]) # Vertical Vector

print("Horizontal Vector: \n",v1)
print("\nVertical Vector: \n",v2)

# All basic operations can be performed on vertors (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
